# DevStandard's Codex CLI executor

Codex does not host the method: the orchestrator is an Antigravity session ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-antigravity-host-with-native-and-codex-executors.md)). It dispatches
Codex as a CLI process — `--implementation codex` for a worker or a read-only gating reviewer — and
this page maps that executor's mechanics for the dispatching session. Method paths resolve from the
installed plugin root. The marked section below is the part `scripts/dispatch` hands a Codex worker.

## Dispatching Codex

Dispatch a worker with `scripts/dispatch ... --implementation codex --wait`, and commission a gating review
through `scripts/review-packet start ... --implementation codex --wait`, which uses the fresh
Codex CLI process and whole-verdict publication path. The CLI must be installed and authenticated.
The injected worker role carries its execution habits directly; no separate craft plugin is required
in Codex or Antigravity (`README.md`'s Install section).
`reference/orchestrator.md`'s Dispatching to an executor section owns when Codex is chosen and its
permission boundaries.

**Verified Codex mechanics.** Run Codex CLI as the dispatch process's child with `--wait`. A linked
worktree needs write grants to both the common `.git` directory and its `.git/worktrees/<name>`
directory; the first grant is not recursive. Codex's `review` subcommand cannot take this contract
and its sandbox controls, so gating review uses plain `exec`. Inspect actual output shape,
including newlines and attribution, before accepting it. These are Codex-specific observations, not
claims about another tool.

A CLI reviewer runs with `workspace-write` and network in a one-off checkout of the packet's
pinned head, under its run scratch (`TMPDIR` or the system temporary directory). Its Git metadata
lives beside that checkout; the only extra write grant is to that copy's metadata, so fetching
history cannot alter the lane's refs or objects. The dispatch process creates the independent clone,
restores the upstream origin, and removes the copy before returning, including a
nonzero exit or handled cancellation. Creation failure returns an error and launches no
reviewer; it never falls back to the lane.

Read-only describes authority toward the repository and its remote: the reviewer never comments,
edits a PR or issue, pushes, or changes remote state. Disposable experiments stay in the copy and
evidence stays pinned; `reference/code-review-prompt.md` carries this rule in every CLI brief.
The caller publishes the verdict. The reviewer `gh api` write-flag hook remains a reminder,
not a complete remote boundary.

For MCP access in a dispatched Codex executor, see `scripts/dispatch`'s `mcp_tool_admission`.
Do not attach a server a worker must not reach to a session that runs workers. When a visible tool
is refused, use `reference/worker.md`'s harness-limit rule.

The hook-trust bypass dispatch passes is invocation-wide, so every hook source Codex has enabled
runs in the child. A DevStandard Codex plugin left installed from a release before 2.0.0 is one such
source: remove it with `codex plugin remove`.

For a Codex CLI run's `--wait` semantics and output paths, use
`scripts/dispatch --help` and `reference/orchestrator.md`'s Dispatching to an executor section.
Preserve run scratch until lane cleanup and read the returned output itself.
Python dispatch supports macOS/Linux; Windows is not qualified.

## Worker mechanics

`scripts/dispatch` delivers this section with `reference/worker.md` to every Codex worker. That
page carries the contract, including what a worker does when the packet cannot be recovered; this
section is the Codex harness under it.

A Codex CLI worker runs inside the OS sandbox dispatch scoped to its lane. A nested `codex exec` is
not a subagent inside your sandbox. Task-local helpers use Codex's native subagent tool, never an
Antigravity process. Specify a helper's model and effort explicitly when its task calls for it;
otherwise use the packet's `Helpers:` defaults for merge/design decisions or everything else.
Helpers never use `scripts/dispatch` or `scripts/review-packet`.

A CLI process begins in its lane. When that directory is a linked worktree on a matching
`task/<issue>-...` branch, `origin` identifies the repository, the latest matching
`devstandard-dispatch-v1` process-run receipt names the lane, and its absolute brief holds the
packet in full. The receipt fits this lane only when its branch and worktree match exactly and
every required field is present; a missing, equally-new, or unreadable receipt or brief leaves the
packet unrecovered, and a partial summary found in the checkout is not one.
